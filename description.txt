DESCRIPTION OF OUR POLICY

Our code implements a 2D cutting stock strategy using Bottom-Left Fill (BLF) 
and column generation. The primary objective is to minimize material usage 
while meeting product requirements.

Key Features and Components:
1. __init__:
    -   Initialize policy_id.
    -   Initialize stock_width and stock_height.
    -   Set up initial_cut_patterns (basic patterns) and required_quantities.

2. get_action:
    -   Determine the best cutting action based on the current stock and product 
        requirements.
    -   Actions include selecting the stock piece and defining the position and 
        size of the cut.

3. BLF Workflow:
    -   Iterate through products sorted by area (largest to smallest).
    -   For each product, check:
        + If it fits into the available stocks in its original or rotated orientation.
        + If yes, find the bottom-left position where it can be placed.
        + If no position is found, move to the next stock.

4. Column Generation Workflow:
    -   Prepare data using _prepare_data_
    -   Iteratively find better cutting patterns by:
        + Solving a linear programming (LP) problem to evaluate existing patterns.
        + Identifying new patterns that can improve the solution.
    -   Solve the master problem of column generation using _solve_ip_problem.

4. Action determination: _determine_action_
    -   Select the stock and cutting position based on the solution.
    -   Ensure that cuts fit within the stock dimensions and meet the product size 
        requirements.
