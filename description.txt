DESCRIPTION OF OUR POLICY

Our code implements a 2D cutting stock strategy using column generation. The main 
objective is to minimize material usage while fulfilling the product requirements.

Key Features and Components:
1. __init__:
    -   Initializes stock_width and stock_height.
    -   Sets upInitialize initial_cut_patterns (basic patterns) and required_quantities.

2. get_action:
    -   Determines the best cutting action based on the current stock and product 
        requirements.
    -   Actions include selecting the stock piece and defining the position and 
        size of the cut.

3. Column Generation Workflow:
    -   Prepares data using _prepare_data_
    -   Iteratively finds better cutting patterns by:
        + Solving a linear programming (LP) problem to evaluate existing patterns.
        + Identifying new patterns that can improve the solution.
    -   Solves the master problem of column generation using _solve_ip_problem.

4. Action determination: _determine_action_
    -   Selects the stock and cutting position based on the solution.
    -   Ensures that cuts fit within the stock dimensions and meet the product size 
        requirements.
