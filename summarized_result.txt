SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OUR POLICY

The implemented algorithm has shown quite good results in solving the two-dimensional 
cutting stock problem, effectively generating cutting patterns to fulfill product 
requirements. However, some limitations have been identified:

1. Stock utilization:
    -   While the policy effectively minimizes stock usage, it does not optimize stock 
        area utilization as efficiently as tools like optiCutter, especially when the 
        option to rotate materials is not considered.

2. Handling varied stock sizes:
    -   The current implementation does not give efficient solution when initial stocks 
        have different sizes.

3. Future direction: To improve the algorithm's performance, future work should focus on:
    -   Enhancing the program to consider rotation of raw materials for better fitting 
        and increased stock utilization.
    -   Handling varied stock sizes.
