SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OUR POLICY

The implemented algorithm has shown good results in solving the two-dimensional 
cutting stock problem, effectively generating cutting patterns to fulfill product 
requirements. However, some limitations have been identified:

1. Stock utilization:
    -   While the policy effectively minimizes stock usage, it does not optimize stock 
        area utilization as efficiently as tools like optiCutter.

2. Handling varied stock sizes:
    -   The current implementation does not provide efficient solutions when initial stocks 
        have different sizes.

3. Future direction: To improve the algorithm's performance, future work should focus on:
    -   Enhancing the program to provide more efficient solutions.
    -   Handling varied stock sizes.
